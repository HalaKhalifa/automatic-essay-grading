    "rationale": "The student's answer correctly explains the greenhouse effect, mentions greenhouse gases (CO2), describes the mechanism (sunlight in, heat trapped), and acknowledges the climate impact (warming). However, it could be more detailed by mentioning specific greenhouse gases or providing a clearer explanation of how they trap heat.",

    "rationale": "The student's answer does not directly address the question about global warming, but instead mentions the greenhouse effect. While related, the two concepts are distinct. A more accurate response would have defined or described global warming and its connection to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions causing a temperature rise.",
